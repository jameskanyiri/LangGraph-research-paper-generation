It was a close contest throughout, but Sinner gained the edge late to secure a 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 win.\\n\\n• **After the match**: Sinner climbed into the stands to embrace loved ones and his team, [who he later credited](https://www.cnn.com/sport/live-news/wimbledon-final-mens-25-07-13-spt#cmd21gss400003b6m46nuk9me) for helping propel him to the victory. In on-court remarks, a smiling Alcaraz congratulated Sinner and said [he’ll “absolutely” be back](https://www.cnn.com/sport/live-news/wimbledon-final-mens-25-07-13-spt#cmd1zxxyy00223b6n2x54kxol) on Centre Court for another Wimbledon final in the future.\\n\\n• **Epic rivalry:** The matchup between two of the game’s brightest young stars once again lived up to the hype. It was a rematch of last month’s [French Open final](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/sport/carlos-alcaraz-jannik-sinner-future-of-tennis-spt-intl), which many consider among the greatest matches in the sport’s history.\\n\\n76 Posts\\n\\n*We’ve wrapped up our live coverage for the day.

Indeed, the Italian’s forehand shot quality in the second set was 9.4, compared with the draw average of 7.3.\\n\\nSinner pumps his fist after taking control of the match.\\n\\nAndrew Couldridge/Reuters\\n\\nAfter a short lull in the third set, with both players holding relatively comfortably, Sinner struck another decisive blow to go 5-4 up, leaving Alcaraz furious after he slipped on the crucial break point.\\n\\nThe Italian had the momentum now and kept at it, producing two brilliant winners in the third game of the fourth set to break Alcaraz again.\\n\\nThe Spaniard had one last chance to get back into the match when he found himself up 15-40 in one game, but could not convert either break point, leaving Sinner to wrap up the win on his next service game.\\n\\nSinner delivers a serve late in the match.\\n\\nKirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nThe world No. 1 now adds a Wimbledon title to the two he has won at the Australian Open and the one he claimed at the US Open. Despite only having won five of his 13 matches against Alcaraz, he is now 2-0 against the Spaniard at Wimbledon.\\n\\nAlcaraz, having lost a grand slam final for the first time in his six appearances, missed out on the chance to join Björn Borg, Pete Sampras, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men in the Open Era to win three Wimbledon titles in a row.\\n\\nLink Copied!\\n\\n## In pictures: Sinner adds a Wimbledon title to his resume\\n\\nFrom CNN\\'s Digital Photo Desk\\n\\nJannik Sinner celebrates after winning match point on Sunday.\\n\\nHenry Nicholls/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nJannik Sinner, the world’s top-ranked player, is now Wimbledon champion for the first time.\\n\\nThe Italian didn’t get off to the best start Sunday, losing the first set to two-time defending champion and world No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz. But he rebounded to win the next three sets in what was an exciting match full of great rallies.\\n\\nThis is now Sinner’s fourth grand slam singles title, to go with two Australian Opens and one US Open.\\n\\nAlcaraz was seeking his third straight Wimbledon title after winning in 2023 and 2024.\\n\\n**See more photos from Sunday’s final:**\\n\\nSinner celebrates with his mother, Siglinde, after the match.\\n\\nStephanie Lecocq/Reuters\\n\\nSinner hits a memorable between-the-legs shot during the match.\\n\\nJoanna Chan/AP\\n\\nCarlos Alcaraz, foreground, competes against Sinner on Centre Court.\\n\\nKin Cheung/AP\\n\\nAt one point in the match, Sinner had to pick up a champagne cork that had fallen onto the court.\\n\\nToby Melville/Reuters\\n\\nAlcaraz stretches for a forehand shot in the first set, which he won.\\n\\nKirsty Wigglesworth/AP\\n\\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales arrive to the Royal Box with their children Prince George and Princess Charlotte to watch the match.\\n\\nKirsty Wigglesworth/AP\\n\\nSinner celebrates with the winner\\'s trophy.\\n\\nKin Cheung/AP\\n\\nLink Copied!\\n\\n## Jannik Sinner on removing a champagne cork from the court: \"Only here at Wimbledon\"\\n\\nFrom CNN\\'s George Ramsay at Wimbledon\\n\\nJannik Sinner delivers his post-match remarks on Centre Court.\\n\\nKirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nIt was, in many ways, a day of firsts for Jannik Sinner: his first Wimbledon title, the first Italian man to hold the trophy, and the first time he’s had a match [interrupted by a champagne cork](https://www.cnn.com/sport/live-news/wimbledon-final-mens-25-07-13-spt#cmd1vyqjm00053b6ml0k8ic1c).\\n\\nThat moment came during the second set, when Sinner had to pause to pick the projectile off the ground and have it removed from the court.\\n\\nSinner flicks a champagne cork that fell onto the court.\\n\\nJulian Finney/Getty Images\\n\\nHaving congratulated Carlos Alcaraz on an “amazing tournament” in his on-court interview, the newly-crowned Wimbledon champion turned his attention to his family and team, singling out his motorsport-loving brother, in particular.\\n\\nSinner’s victory here at the All England Lawn Tennis Club avenges his brutal loss to Alcaraz at the [French Open](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/sport/carlos-alcaraz-jannik-sinner-future-of-tennis-spt-intl) last month, during which he let slip a commanding lead and lost three championship points.\\n\\nThe world No. 1 pointed to the experience as one of the reasons that he’s been able to win a first Wimbledon crown this year.\\n\\nLink Copied!\\n\\n## Alcaraz says he\\'s proud of Wimbledon campaign — and he\\'ll \"absolutely\" be back\\n\\nFrom CNN\\'s Ben Church\\n\\nCarlos Alcaraz addresses the crowd after the match.\\n\\nToby Melville/Reuters\\n\\nHe may have lost this final, but Carlos Alcaraz is still able to see it all in perspective.\\n\\nAt just 22, he’s already won two Wimbledon titles, two French Opens and a US Open.

Despite hitting 15 aces, the Spaniard was accurate with just 53% of his first serves – a sizeable drop-off from the 65% he managed in the semifinal against Taylor Fritz, and well below Sinner’s 62% today.\\n\\nHe struggled even more when he had to serve twice, winning just 51% of his second-serve points, compared to Sinner’s 60%. The Spaniard also made seven double faults to Sinner’s two.\\n\\nSinner was able to use his serve as a real weapon as the match wore on and both players began to tire.

I mean, if y\\'all are true Christians crew, then y\\'all know why I\\'m dressed like this. Always dressed crazy whenever it\\'s a crazy result. And we definitely witnessed a crazy result this Saturday morning. EA\\'s fiance. She won her sixlam singles title, defeating Amanda Anie Samova. Six love, six love. Yes, I said that correctly. Six love, six love. She gave a double bagel in the final of Wimbledon. Shiance now ties Monica Celis with the best undefeated slam record to start being six in love, winning her first six slam singles finals. And now she\\'s one away from matching Roger Federer, who has the all-time record of winning his first SL seven slam singles titles. EGA also becomes the eighth woman all time to win majors on all three different surfaces. I\\'ll give a short but sweet analysis of that center court clobbering and talk about what fiance\\'s win means for her legacy and whether we\\'re in for another period of ego dominance in the upcoming future. Hello, my name is Christian Basnight and welcome to Christian\\'s Quote where I cover tennis from all angles. If you have not yet already, make sure you subscribe and click the notification bell so you\\'re notified whenever I post new new content. Now, the fact that this was a beatdown really wasn\\'t a surprise to me, but Amanda had absolutely no business losing this one. Six love, six love, and she had her chances to at least get a game on the board, but she just dug herself deeper holes with just the lack of scoreboard pressure that she applied on EGA. She was broken right off the bat at 15. That just sent a horrible message and that didn\\'t help her settle any nerves at all. And she lost the match really I feel in the third game of the match when she was down love two because she had four game point opportunities to get on the board but she wasn\\'t able to capitalize and that remained the only time where she had a game point opportunity that only game that third game of the first set getting broken right off the bat in set number two. I think that was the final nail in the coffin for the American and with how well EGA had been serving not not only throughout this entire championships but again in this match. Amanda needed to have a perfect serving day and that day was not today at all. And Ega she cruised on her serve. She didn\\'t face a single break point while Amanda struggled immensely. Annie Samova, she hit zero aces, five double faults. She only made 45% of her first serves in the box and she only won 25% of the points whenever she did so. and she won more points behind her second serve, although it wasn\\'t that great. She won 35% of her second serve points. Ego though was on point on her serve. She made 78% of her first serves and she won 72% of her points whenever she did this and she won 63% of her second serve points. The winner to unforced error ratio tells a lot, too. Amanda, she hit eight winners to 28 unforced errors. Meanwhile, EA kept it clean and tidy with 10 winners to 11 unforced errors. Everything I mentioned in my finals preview really happened. Like I\\'m not going to spend too much time going over this match because first of all, there\\'s not much to go over, but I mentioned in my last video that Amanda, she was low-key very beatable in that semi-final against Sabalinka. Even though she did play well in that match, Arena let her off the hook big time with just missed returns. She missed so many returns. And I knew that Eagle would not do this considering how Shian is probably one of the most the best returners that we have right now on the tour. She\\'s just simply more consistent and she made Amanda play a lot more shots compared to Arena. EGA is just overall more consistent from the ground and she was able to draw more errors from Amanda able to more spread the court and maneuver Anisova around and we all know that Amanda is much more vulnerable on the move compared to whenever she is stationary and Samova no doubt she was already gassed from that Sabanka semi-final. So with EA moving her even more like at pretty much every point where Amanda was stretched wide she lost. And I know that some people were like, \"Oh, Annie Samova will bring her a new power that she hasn\\'t seen before.\" But I knew that was kind of cap because EGA has faced big hitters throughout this entire tournament. She faced Collins, beat her routinely. She beat Clara Talson routinely. She beat Samson Sonova pretty routinely. So, she was prepared for the pace and the power that Anisova would bring and she wasn\\'t phased at all. And I knew that EGA\\'s team would employ a great strategy for this match. And that was just attacking Anisova\\'s forehand relentlessly. Yes, Annie Samova\\'s forehand was not as sharp as it was against Sabalanka in that semi-final, but I also think that Arena gave Amanda way too many backhands to work with. Then on the flip side, I think that Annie Samova did not exploit EGA\\'s forehand at all. She didn\\'t really get out to the punch and try to pressure forehand. I don\\'t know what strategy she came out with, but it was the losing strategy. And I still think that if she had tried to pressure EA\\'s forehand a bit more, she could have drawn more unforced errors from Shiion, but she did not she did not do that at all. And I also think that a lot of EGA\\'s unforced errors from that wing, crazy unforced errors, come whenever things are tight for her and she wasn\\'t really tight at all in this final. I truly think that if Sabalinka had a better game plan, she could have beaten Anisova 6463 amidst how well Anisova was playing that match. Again, I do think that Amanda was pretty beatable. That said, I think Amanda\\'s this being her first ever match against EGA, let alone in a Wimbledon final, that was just a recipe for disaster. And the a lot of people have talked about how whenever you face Ego for the first time, that\\'s you need that experience of facing her because it\\'s really nothing like what many players bring at you on the tour at all. Plus, EGA, she\\'s just more experienced at this level and at these final stages. Coming into this one, she was 5-0 in major finals, 22 and five overall in finals, and then I think Anisova was like 2 and three, 3 and two in finals. And she of course has never been in this position of contesting for a slam trophy. EGA, I don\\'t even think she was in her top top shape. Yes, she played well, but I don\\'t think she was in like godlike form um in this final. She really didn\\'t have to bring it much because Anisova gifted her a lot with unforced errors. And I do think that she was vulnerable like a little bit. She showed some signs of vulnerability, but again, Anisova was way too shaky to take advantage and apply ample scoreboard pressure. I think this definitely is the worst land final that we\\'ve seen in decades. I think that alltime title belongs to Stephie Graph defeating Natasha Zva in the 1988 Roland Gar\\'s final where she again beat her six love six love but this one was 34 minutes. So at least this one was a little bit longer. It almost hit an hour mark. But I simply believe that there is only one woman to blame for this lopsided result and that\\'s Simona Halip. Halup was in attendance in the Royal box to watch this final. And I think that the spirit of 2019 win over over Serena just took over the censor court with her being there. And it\\'s crazy to me that even with this being a six love six love beatd down, it was still 1 minute longer than Serena\\'s 6262 loss to Halip in 2019. So so triggering. But anyways, I am the type of person to look at things from a glass half full perspective. So here\\'s this. I think that it is poetic for Amanda to start her win tournament with a six love six love beatd down win over Julia Poinsa in like 44 minutes than to end her tournament losing six love six love in the finals. That\\'s something that that\\'s kind of beautiful honestly in a way that you know ying and yang and and stuff. I mean I\\'m trying here y\\'all. I\\'m trying. But in all seriousness I do feel for Amanda for sure. And it was triggering for triggering for me low-key because for my high school state final. I of course played tennis. I lost six love, six love. Granted, I did have um three game points in the first game, but the guy was just better than me. That was the whole case. But with Amanda, it was different because she was a little bit more gassed. But point being, I understand where she\\'s coming from and playing like the biggest match of your career and getting like goose egged or double bag. It\\'s definitely not easy. It was beautiful though to see that moment with her and her mom. You know, she got really emotional and I think this was the first time where her mom flew out to watch her play because Amanda was superstitious. I mean, superstitions are for a reason. So, I think Amanda\\'s mama probably should have stayed home. I\\'m not saying she would have won this match, but maybe she would have won at least a game if Amanda\\'s mama decided to stay home. I really think that this one just came down to to nerves. And even Amanda said in her postmatch press conference that she was a little bit frozen coming out to play this match. Amanda also said, \"I didn\\'t practice yesterday. I think that was just really fatigue. I could feel it also in my warm-up this morning. I mean, I had to take a break after every single rally out there in my warm-up. I think if anything, it\\'s my physicality that I need to work on to be able to last two weeks in a Grand Slam is definitely something that you need to work on a lot. It\\'s not an easy feat. Yeah, there\\'s a lot of room for improvement. If anything, I think it\\'s more experience for me on how to handle my nerves. It\\'s my first final, so at least I have that experience now.\" I do think that of course Amanda will be able to recover okay from this even though this was a pretty embarrassing result. She has a good excuse of her being a little bit more gassed and this being her first slam final. Will this be her first and last slam final? If I were to guess, I\\'d say I think she\\'ll be in this position before. Um I think that she will win a slam at least. She\\'s still only 23 years old, so she she still has time for sure. And she at least will walk away being a slam finalist. Even if she does never reach another slam final, she can have that in the back of her pocket. And focusing on the present, she will leave a top 10 player. She will make her top 10 debut on Monday, sitting at number seven in the rankings. So, she still has so much to be proud of, and this will be a huge milestone in her making his final. And I feel like a lot of us will remember that epic South Blanca semi-final win. So congratulations to Amanda. Just thinking back to where she was not even 2 years ago, a year and a half ago on that hiatus and now being back in a slam final, she would have taken this even if she even though she did lose Love and Love, she would have definitely taken this 10 times out of 10. So it\\'s still an inspiring feat for her to come back and after taking that mental health hiatus and make us final. So again, full props to Amanda for for her effort and in coming back. Now, talking about our champion, I mean, what more to say? And it\\'s wow, too, that this is EGA\\'s 100th slam singles win, main draw win. And really, what a way to do it to to win love and love in a woman final to win your first Wimbledon title. And we really shouldn\\'t be surprised though because the legendary Venus Golf, they did predict this essentially before the tournament started. So, congratulations to Venus Golf for defending their Wimbledon title and predicting the the correct women\\'s champion two years in a row before the draw even dropped. So, got to give props to Venus Golf. I also think that it\\'s a cool parallel between Koko and EGA because they both won junior titles in 2018. Koko won Roland Garros, Ego won, and now here we are 7 years later and they won, you know, Koko won Roland Garos the women\\'s uh edition. Ego won Wimbledon women\\'s edition. Really, EA just quieted the critics with this title run. Undoubtedly, Bud Onborg was so instrumental to her and her getting this success and getting this win because even though she didn\\'t win the title, her getting over the semi-finals hump and actually, you know, winning a semi-final after not winning one in over a year was huge and gave her a lot of confidence. And I think her year, even though people called it a flop year, it wasn\\'t a bad year overall when you look at it because she played really well at the majors, making the semi-finals at both the Australian Open and Roland Geros. And I think that she really was a point away from winning the Australian Open. I think that if she did get that match point over Keys, she would have won in the final against Sabalinka. I can\\'t say that definitively, but that\\'s just my opinion. playing devil\\'s advocate. I mean, we can say that she did have a decline in form because some of her losses, namely Yala Miami, that was a rough loss. Golf, yes, Koko played amazing, but being double bread stick, EGA played horribly. And I think at in those losses, her forehand just went ary, but here her forehand stuck together and that\\'s ultimately why she won the title. It was a clean title run from her. And EGA, she says something important to ESPN. She said that she enjoyed her center court experience playing on center court, not being nervous about it. And that\\'s ultimately what made the difference between her and Amanda. She put no pressure on herself, not only for this final, but leading into it. You know, she was at her lowest in a while because people were not expecting much at all from her. And that just goes to show how much of that struggle period that EGA faced was due to her nerves. because now that she came into Wen without any like really pressure or expectation, she ran the gauntlet and won the tournament with relative ease. And I do feel like somewhat of an apology is owed to Wim Fett because I raised the question plenty of times of whether he eager needed to fire Whim, especially after she wasn\\'t able to win Roland Geralt. But the main reason of why she brought Whim in is to have success outside of Roland Garros. And they accomplished the goal together. What more can you ask for? She won Wimbledon, the one title that people thought that she might never win. Whim did his job. Full credit to Whim. I mean, I stand corrected. I\\'m I\\'m one to give people, you know, their tens and when it\\'s due and when I\\'m wrong, I\\'m wrong. And I was definitely wrong here. So, congratulations to Whim, of course, too. And EGA, she proved a lot for sure with this title run that she can thrive on any surface. She was very aggressive throughout this tournament and she made big improvements on her serve and she was not relying too as much on her defense, but she was still able to draw a lot of unforced errors from her opponent just based off of how solid she was from the ground. And like I mentioned in my finals preview, much of Eagle\\'s EGA struggles at Wen in the past, I think were rooted in her exerting a lot of her energy for the clay swing, just winning dang near everything. Now this year, she didn\\'t win a single thing. She came in much more like refreshed I feel and more motivated to do better at Wen. I think that Ego was a bit more complacent in Warden\\'s previous years because she again expended all her energy on the clay swing. She\\'d won a lot this year. She came in hungry, motivated and also without the pressure and that\\'s what resulted in this this title. Now, another talking point I want to briefly touch on because I know that people will will say it is that EGA had a cakewalk draw. And I don\\'t know if I necessarily say that because on paper before the draw kind of crumbled, EGA had a tough draw. I mean, she was in the section with Rebakina, a former Women Champion. Although Rebakina isn\\'t the same, Robbakina that won Wimbledon those years prior, she\\'s still a tough out on grass. And it\\'s not her fault that Rebaka lost. And still even then Clara Talson was playing well and she\\'s a good opponent. Danielle Collins is dangerous. She beat EA the last time they played on Clay Ega\\'s best surface. So that was a good win. And Sam Senova again a solid opponent. And yes, we cannot deny that Benic and Anamova did not bring their best games at all. Didn\\'t really test EA at all. And EGA, she actually finished the tournament 19 games won in a row dating back from that Benich semi-final which is incredible. But I mean, there\\'s nothing much that EGA could have done to prevent that. Like, EGA did her job and won. And that\\'s simple as that. It\\'s not her fault either that the top seeds flopped so bad and fell early in week one. She simply was the best. And I don\\'t know how many people could have beaten her in this tournament. I think that even if Sabalinka made the finals, EGA would have won. Danger wouldn\\'t have been no love and love, but wouldn\\'t be surprised if it were straight sets win for EGA\\'s favor. And it\\'s crazy to think in hindsight that Katie McN was the one that tested Fiance the most. And it\\'s obvious because Katie brings a different challenge and that she isn\\'t a a big ball basher and that she brings in more variety. But to that brings back to another point of that we all think of EGA to struggle the most against the bigger hitters, but she handled every single big hitter. She passed the test tremendously. So again, props to EGA for that. Looking ahead, the question is, what can we expect from EGA from here on out? Will we experience another EGA dominance era and period? I\\'m leaning more towards no simply because I do think that regardless of how well EGA played, the tour is just more tough compared to 2022 and the players will challenge her still on even still on the faster surfaces. Having predictions for EGA slam total count, I think that she will at least get to 15 slams. She\\'s already at six. She\\'s 24 years old and it\\'s crazy that she\\'s one away from Venus, which as a Venus fan, that\\'s disappointing that she wasn\\'t able to win more slams. I mean, yes, she can. Venus can add to her slam tally. She\\'s coming back. She\\'s playing DC. Um, so maybe she can get her eighth at the US Open. You never know. You never know. Crazier things have No, that that\\'s not going to happen. But I think that regardless, this was a big hurdle for her to overcome this, you know, down period that she faced, even though the down period wasn\\'t even that bad because she even talked to ESPN about it. She said that the critics got to her a little bit. And she said that now that she got this title, she hopes that people will kind of like shut up, for lack of a better word, and let her do her job. And I think it\\'ll be a weight lifted off her shoulder now that she got o again got over the hump and won a slam title. So, I don\\'t know. the tour. The tour might need to be shaken in their boots a little bit now that EGA is definitely back and out of the trenches. So, not much more to say except for congratulations to both Venus Golf and EGA on an incredible Wimbledon run. That is all I have for this Wimbledon women\\'s final recap video and let me know your thoughts on it. And I know there\\'s going to be plenty of strong opinionated opinions on it, but please in the comments, not too much on Amanda. She was gassed and this was her first final appearance. So, be kind to the comments, y\\'all. Also, let me know your thoughts on EGA\\'s future and whether you think that she can get to 15 slams and maybe beyond, maybe even reach 20 slams. Again, make sure you all subscribe and click the notification bell so you are notified whenever I post my Wimbledon men\\'s final recap video. Thank you all so much for watching and for your support. And I will see you all next time here on Christian\\'s Court.'},\n",

Welcome to the press conference for Carlos Alcarez. Please raise your hand if you would like to ask a question. Carlos, obviously not the result you were hoping for today, but overall a good championships. Yeah, it's uh I mean it's it's always a a bad feeling, you know, losing losing matches. I think it's a little bit uh even even worse when you you're losing a final. But, you know, overall, I'm just really proud about everything. I I I've done, you know, the the last four weeks on on grass here in in London and just uh leave uh leave Wimbledon, I just left the court with the with the head really really high because you know that I just uh did everything that I could today just I played against uh someone who who played an unbelievable uh unbelievable game. So just uh uh a little bit sad about losing but with the with the head really high. Simon, Not a serot today it felt like you weren't a serot today. Not a serot. I mean, it was uh today was complicated a little bit. Uh, you know, low percentage of of of first serve and then, you know, I I was uh I played against uh one of the best returning on on tour without doubt. So, uh it was u it was a weapon that uh I wish uh I wish he could he it he could uh be better but uh today was um I mean with the with the nerfs and and everything it was difficult to to serve better so I just have to to improve that. Yeah, absolutely. What did you learn from last summer Matt, uh hey Carlos. Uh tough tough luck. Um, the last time you lost a big final like this last summer at the Olympics, it it took you a while to sort of bounce back, it seemed like. And I'm sort of curious, what did you learn from that experience that you can now apply to this experience about bouncing back and moving on? Well, I think it's different. Uh, it's it's a different a different feeling uh to be honest. Uh yeah, LA last year, you know, in the Olympics, I just uh I was uh I was I was really uh bad emotionally uh after after the match. So it was it was really really hard for me to to accept that uh that moment. Uh and and right now I think that you know in the last in the last year uh I've been through in a different situations that I that I learned uh I learned from from then and right now I'm in a position that I've I've uh I've spoken a few times already that okay I just uh I just accept everything that is coming to me uh in the way it comes like uh okay I just uh I I just lost a final in a grand slam, but I just really proud about being in a final. So, um I just want to to keep uh the the good moments uh and trying to forget, you know, the uh the like the bad moments and just want to think like, okay, I I just played the final grand slam and trying to forget that I lost it. It's just about I I I was able to play it. Uh, and I just want to to accept it. So, right now I'm just, as I said, I'm not I'm not bad at all. Uh, I'm just uh happy. Uh, I'm smiling because uh in my head is it was about playing playing the final and uh and be grateful grateful for that. The rivalry with Daniil Medvedev Hi, Carlos. The rivalry with Yanik. Um, how much does it mean for you to have an opponent at that level and where do you think this rivalry is going? Well, I first of all, I just really really happy about having this rivalry with with him. Uh I think it's is great for for us is and and it is great for the tennis. Uh every time we we playing against each other, I think we our level is is really high. I I think we we don't we don't watch uh a level a level like this if I'm if I'm honest with you. uh I don't see any any player playing against each other uh you know having the level that they we playing when when we face each other. I think as I said many many times this rivalry is is it's uh coming better than better. We're building a really great rivalry because we're playing final of a grand slam final of master of master the best tournament in the world. So um and and it's going to be better and better and I'm just really grateful for for that because it gives me uh the opportunity to to just uh give my 100% every practice every day just to just to be better thanks thanks to that because you know the level uh that I have to maintain and I have to raise if I want to beat Danik is uh is really high. So I just really grateful for that. Did Daniil surprise you Helena, hi Carlos BL today. Obviously the the defeat for Yanick in Paris was a really difficult one. Did he surprise you with the way he was able to get over that so quickly and and come back and win here? Not at all. The he didn't surprise me at all because uh I know he's a really nice uh player and uh a huge champion. Uh and the the the champions uh learn from from the I'm not going to say failures, but uh they they they learn from the from the losers. Uh, and I knew at the beginning that he was going to to learn from from that final. Uh, not going to uh make the same the same mistakes as u as they did in in in the French Open final. So u the way he played today was uh it was really really high and I didn't surprise at all. It was uh or I knew he he was playing he was going to play like this. Um, so he was uh he was about some some details uh and and uh yeah I mean overall it's he didn't he didn't surprise surprise me at all because I know he's a he's a big champion. How did you feel during the match Carol, can I just ask you how you felt in terms of energy during this match because it seemed that maybe in the middle of this match you hit a bit of a rough patch of energy physically. Did you feel you had enough in the time to to go the distance today? Well, he just um No, I didn't I didn't feel down uh physically at all during during the match. It was uh it was all about uh you know, he was pushing me uh to the limit in in every point. So mentally sometimes it's really tough to maintain you know the uh the good focus or the good level uh during the whole match when when you see the opponent just playing such a great tennis uh and at some points I I didn't know what what I had to do uh in the match because uh from the baselines from the baseline I was uh I was feeling he was better than me and I couldn't do anything about it. Um and um and I think you know big uh the big key was uh it was about the second serve. So he he was returning really well the second serve that I that he was hitting uh and uh it is uh and thanks to that he he was in the position to attack in the in the second ball every time. So it was really difficult when you're feeling that you you just defending all the time and running from from side to side all the time. So that that that was my my feeling but I didn't I didn't fail down physically that and that that the What did you need to do better answer. Okay. Last English question. Willie Carlos, what do you think you need to do better if anything to do better against him next time? Well, I think uh well surfaces are really uh you know different. Uh and I think for example today playing on grass I think the sec as I said as I said the second ser are really really important and I and I feel like I just uh gave him a lot of free points when he was serving the second serve. Uh, okay. He has a big first serve. That's obviously and I just try to return or win points from the first side that that it is more more difficult. But that when when you're have the chance to return a second serve, I had to to do more uh with uh with those points. I had to return better. I had to uh or I had to try to be in the position of attack after the the return. And um you know I just uh felt he was uh serving really or or quite quite easily uh and he was winning his uh surf game quite easily because uh because of that it wasn't uh push uh push him you know to to have nerves you know on the on the serves game. So I I think I have to be better on on that. Overall it was a it was a great match. I think the level from the best was really high and uh I think that that was the the big different between both of us today. Okay, thank you. We'll switch to Spanish questions.\"},\n",

That's it. Y takes his piece of Wimbledon history. What a wonderful match. Heat up here. Yan ends the reign of Carlos Alarez. A triumph at Wimbledon. And after the pain, the agony of that friendship and loss and in a fourth Grand Slam final in a row, he shows the strength of his character. And now he makes the walk and will be guided to the player support box. And they've been through it, too. right from when he took up this silly game. And that's really, really nice. Darren Cahill and the team and they've played their part from the moment that he left home at 13 and pursued this sport rather than skiing or football. He was destined to be a very fine player, but who's to say who will become a grand slam champion and who will not. Well, mom looks a lot happier than she did at the French Open after 5 and 1/2 hours. It's an incredible performance and it's a team effort. You can see what it means to everyone up there and 35 days ago to go through that heartache of Roland Garrison, then come back here in his next Grand Slam opportunity and take the title. Well, it it does show you how incredibly mentally strong he is. And there's his mom and a hug for her. But the resilience he's shown this year, we know he's gone through his battles on and off the court. But to come back from Paris and to make this statement shows how good he is and how good he is going to be for many years to come. In many ways, this is a good thing for the rivalry because Alcarez had won five straight matches against him. And now Sinn proves to himself after a break of nearly two years that he can beat Arazz on the biggest stages.\"}],\n",

Here\\'s how to make it\\n\\n01:51\\n\\n## Today at Wimbledon\\n\\n• **Men’s singles champion:** World No. 1 [Jannik Sinner](https://www.cnn.com/sport/live-news/wimbledon-final-mens-25-07-13-spt/#cmd1p3u9b00053b6m70w0qnud) won his first Wimbledon title in a hard-fought battle with two-time reigning champion [Carlos Alcaraz](https://www.cnn.com/sport/live-news/wimbledon-final-mens-25-07-13-spt/#cmd1q0wi6000u356mzwp99d7t). It was a close contest throughout, but Sinner gained the edge late to secure a 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 win.\\n\\n• **After the match**: Sinner climbed into the stands to embrace loved ones and his team, [who he later credited](https://www.cnn.com/sport/live-news/wimbledon-final-mens-25-07-13-spt#cmd21gss400003b6m46nuk9me) for helping propel him to the victory. In on-court remarks, a smiling Alcaraz congratulated Sinner and said [he’ll “absolutely” be back](https://www.cnn.com/sport/live-news/wimbledon-final-mens-25-07-13-spt#cmd1zxxyy00223b6n2x54kxol) on Centre Court for another Wimbledon final in the future.\\n\\n• **Epic rivalry:** The matchup between two of the game’s brightest young stars once again lived up to the hype. It was a rematch of last month’s [French Open final](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/sport/carlos-alcaraz-jannik-sinner-future-of-tennis-spt-intl), which many consider among the greatest matches in the sport’s history.\\n\\n76 Posts\\n\\n*We’ve wrapped up our live coverage for the day. You can relive the match as it happened by reading through the posts below.*\\n\\nLink Copied!\\n\\n## Jannik Sinner shows resolve to win first Wimbledon title: Catch up on today\\'s final\\n\\nFrom CNN\\'s Jamie Barton\\n\\nJannik Sinner poses with his trophy after the match.\\n\\nKirsty Wigglesworth/AP\\n\\nJannik Sinner is the men’s singles champion at Wimbledon for the first time after he came from a set down to beat two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4.\\n\\nAfter the sport’s new “Big Two” played out one of the greatest matches of all time in the final of Roland Garros five weeks ago, today’s rematch did not disappoint — there was some terrific tennis on display here throughout.\\n\\nSinner looked to have taken control in the first set when he broke his opponent’s serve in the fifth game to take a 3-2 lead, only for Alcaraz to break back twice — the second time thanks in part to a suddenly nervous looking Sinner, who double-faulted to give the Spaniard an advantage, which he wasted no time in taking.\\n\\nCarlos Alcaraz hits a backhand in the first set.\\n\\nKin Cheung/AP\\n\\nWith the memory of that French Open final — which Sinner somehow lost despite going two sets up and having three championship points — still fresh on everyone’s minds, it would have been easy for the Italian to wonder whether he had once again passed up an opportunity for a grand slam title.\\n\\nBut the world No. 1 steeled himself and played a magnificent second set, breaking Alcaraz in the first game and holding from then onward.\\n\\nIn particular, his final game of the set was so impressive, hitting two stunning forehands to tie the match. Indeed, the Italian’s forehand shot quality in the second set was 9.4, compared with the draw average of 7.3.\\n\\nSinner pumps his fist after taking control of the match.\\n\\nAndrew Couldridge/Reuters\\n\\nAfter a short lull in the third set, with both players holding relatively comfortably, Sinner struck another decisive blow to go 5-4 up, leaving Alcaraz furious after he slipped on the crucial break point.\\n\\nThe Italian had the momentum now and kept at it, producing two brilliant winners in the third game of the fourth set to break Alcaraz again.\\n\\nThe Spaniard had one last chance to get back into the match when he found himself up 15-40 in one game, but could not convert either break point, leaving Sinner to wrap up the win on his next service game.\\n\\nSinner delivers a serve late in the match.\\n\\nKirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nThe world No. 1 now adds a Wimbledon title to the two he has won at the Australian Open and the one he claimed at the US Open. Despite only having won five of his 13 matches against Alcaraz, he is now 2-0 against the Spaniard at Wimbledon.\\n\\nAlcaraz, having lost a grand slam final for the first time in his six appearances, missed out on the chance to join Björn Borg, Pete Sampras, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men in the Open Era to win three Wimbledon titles in a row.\\n\\nLink Copied!\\n\\n## In pictures: Sinner adds a Wimbledon title to his resume\\n\\nFrom CNN\\'s Digital Photo Desk\\n\\nJannik Sinner celebrates after winning match point on Sunday.\\n\\nHenry Nicholls/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nJannik Sinner, the world’s top-ranked player, is now Wimbledon champion for the first time.\\n\\nThe Italian didn’t get off to the best start Sunday, losing the first set to two-time defending champion and world No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz. But he rebounded to win the next three sets in what was an exciting match full of great rallies.\\n\\nThis is now Sinner’s fourth grand slam singles title, to go with two Australian Opens and one US Open.\\n\\nAlcaraz was seeking his third straight Wimbledon title after winning in 2023 and 2024.\\n\\n**See more photos from Sunday’s final:**\\n\\nSinner celebrates with his mother, Siglinde, after the match.\\n\\nStephanie Lecocq/Reuters\\n\\nSinner hits a memorable between-the-legs shot during the match.\\n\\nJoanna Chan/AP\\n\\nCarlos Alcaraz, foreground, competes against Sinner on Centre Court.\\n\\nKin Cheung/AP\\n\\nAt one point in the match, Sinner had to pick up a champagne cork that had fallen onto the court.\\n\\nToby Melville/Reuters\\n\\nAlcaraz stretches for a forehand shot in the first set, which he won.\\n\\nKirsty Wigglesworth/AP\\n\\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales arrive to the Royal Box with their children Prince George and Princess Charlotte to watch the match.\\n\\nKirsty Wigglesworth/AP\\n\\nSinner celebrates with the winner\\'s trophy.\\n\\nKin Cheung/AP\\n\\nLink Copied!\\n\\n## Jannik Sinner on removing a champagne cork from the court: \"Only here at Wimbledon\"\\n\\nFrom CNN\\'s George Ramsay at Wimbledon\\n\\nJannik Sinner delivers his post-match remarks on Centre Court.\\n\\nKirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nIt was, in many ways, a day of firsts for Jannik Sinner: his first Wimbledon title, the first Italian man to hold the trophy, and the first time he’s had a match [interrupted by a champagne cork](https://www.cnn.com/sport/live-news/wimbledon-final-mens-25-07-13-spt#cmd1vyqjm00053b6ml0k8ic1c).\\n\\nThat moment came during the second set, when Sinner had to pause to pick the projectile off the ground and have it removed from the court.\\n\\nSinner flicks a champagne cork that fell onto the court.\\n\\nJulian Finney/Getty Images\\n\\nHaving congratulated Carlos Alcaraz on an “amazing tournament” in his on-court interview, the newly-crowned Wimbledon champion turned his attention to his family and team, singling out his motorsport-loving brother, in particular.\\n\\nSinner’s victory here at the All England Lawn Tennis Club avenges his brutal loss to Alcaraz at the [French Open](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/sport/carlos-alcaraz-jannik-sinner-future-of-tennis-spt-intl) last month, during which he let slip a commanding lead and lost three championship points.\\n\\nThe world No. 1 pointed to the experience as one of the reasons that he’s been able to win a first Wimbledon crown this year.\\n\\nLink Copied!\\n\\n## Alcaraz says he\\'s proud of Wimbledon campaign — and he\\'ll \"absolutely\" be back\\n\\nFrom CNN\\'s Ben Church\\n\\nCarlos Alcaraz addresses the crowd after the match.\\n\\nToby Melville/Reuters\\n\\nHe may have lost this final, but Carlos Alcaraz is still able to see it all in perspective.\\n\\nAt just 22, he’s already won two Wimbledon titles, two French Opens and a US Open. That being said, he did not appear overly disappointed in today’s defeat.\\n\\n“Really, really happy, really proud about everything I’m doing,” he said during his on-court interview after the final.\\n\\n“It’s a great journey so far that I’m really proud about and I want to keep it going.”\\n\\nIn many ways, today’s final result is perfect for the [emerging rivalry](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/sport/carlos-alcaraz-jannik-sinner-future-of-tennis-spt-intl) between these two generational talents. Both have now proven they can beat the other on the biggest stages, and Alcaraz is confident he’ll be back within a shot of a Wimbledon title again.\\n\\nYou imagine a repeat of this year’s final isn’t too far away.\\n\\nLink Copied!\\n\\n## Carlos Alcaraz was let down by his serve today\\n\\nFrom CNN\\'s Jamie Barton\\n\\nCarlos Alcaraz serves during Sunday\\'s final.\\n\\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images\\n\\nToday’s men’s final was, in many ways, the polar opposite of yesterday’s women’s final – for most of the contest, Alcaraz vs Sinner was a match of fine margins.\\n\\nBoth players made a similar number of unforced errors – Sinner 40, Alcaraz 36 – and hit a similar number of winners – 40 and 38, respectively.\\n\\nBut where Alcaraz did fall down was in his serving. Despite hitting 15 aces, the Spaniard was accurate with just 53% of his first serves – a sizeable drop-off from the 65% he managed in the semifinal against Taylor Fritz, and well below Sinner’s 62% today.\\n\\nHe struggled even more when he had to serve twice, winning just 51% of his second-serve points, compared to Sinner’s 60%. The Spaniard also made seven double faults to Sinner’s two.\\n\\nSinner was able to use his serve as a real weapon as the match wore on and both players began to tire. Unfortunately for those backing Alcaraz, the Spaniard could not do the same.\\n\\nLink Copied!\\n\\n## Princess of Wales presents Jannik Sinner with the Wimbledon trophy\\n\\nFrom CNN\\'s George Ramsay at Wimbledon\\n\\nCatherine, Princess of Wales, presents Jannik Sinner with the winner\\'s trophy.\\n\\nAndrew Couldridge/Reuters\\n\\nCatherine, Princess of Wales, has come down from the Royal Box to award the winner’s and runner-up trophies.\\n\\nShe speaks to both players as they’re called up to collect their awards, with Jannik Sinner raising his golden trophy to the crowd.\\n\\nLink Copied!\\n\\n## Jannik Sinner wins his first Wimbledon title\\n\\nFrom CNN\\'s Jamie Barton\\n\\nJannik Sinner raises his arms in victory.\\n\\nToby Melville/Reuters\\n\\nJannik Sinner defeats Carlos Alcaraz 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to win his first Wimbledon title.\\n\\nThe Italian holds to 15 to round out a historic victory – he is the first Italian man to win a singles title in SW19.\\n\\nAlcaraz has given it his all, never more so than at 30-0 when he puts in two huge slides to try and stay in the rally. He cannot return the second.\\n\\nOne championship point comes and goes for Sinner when he netted with a backhand. But the second would not elude him, with Alcaraz unable to return one last big serve.\\n\\nSinner raises his arms in celebration. It’s his day!\\n\\nSinner embraces Carlos Alcaraz after their match.\\n\\nStephanie Lecocq/Reuters\\n\\nLink Copied!\\n\\n## Alcaraz holds to make it 5-4, but Sinner serving for Wimbledon title\\n\\nFrom CNN\\'s Ben Church\\n\\nIt all comes down to the next game.\\n\\nAlcaraz holds but Sinner can win the Wimbledon title by holding his next service game.\\n\\nTwo weeks of competition come down to this.\\n\\nLink Copied!\\n\\n## Sinner recovers from 15-40 to hold and go within touching distance of win\\n\\nFrom CNN\\'s Jamie Barton\\n\\nJannik Sinner is now one game away from the championship.\\n\\nKirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nOnce again, Alcaraz goes up 0-15. It’s the first point the Italian has lost this set after getting his first serve in, according to the BBC broadcast.\\n\\nChants of “*Sí, se puede!*” (“Yes, it’s possible!” in Spanish) are heard around Centre Court.\\n\\nSinner pulls it back to 15-15, but suddenly it’s 15-40!\\n\\nAlcaraz nets to bring it back to 30-40, and then goes marginally long after a rally.

I mean, if y\\'all are true Christians crew, then y\\'all know why I\\'m dressed like this. Always dressed crazy whenever it\\'s a crazy result. And we definitely witnessed a crazy result this Saturday morning. EA\\'s fiance. She won her sixlam singles title, defeating Amanda Anie Samova. Six love, six love. Yes, I said that correctly. Six love, six love. She gave a double bagel in the final of Wimbledon. Shiance now ties Monica Celis with the best undefeated slam record to start being six in love, winning her first six slam singles finals. And now she\\'s one away from matching Roger Federer, who has the all-time record of winning his first SL seven slam singles titles. EGA also becomes the eighth woman all time to win majors on all three different surfaces. I\\'ll give a short but sweet analysis of that center court clobbering and talk about what fiance\\'s win means for her legacy and whether we\\'re in for another period of ego dominance in the upcoming future. Hello, my name is Christian Basnight and welcome to Christian\\'s Quote where I cover tennis from all angles. If you have not yet already, make sure you subscribe and click the notification bell so you\\'re notified whenever I post new new content. Now, the fact that this was a beatdown really wasn\\'t a surprise to me, but Amanda had absolutely no business losing this one. Six love, six love, and she had her chances to at least get a game on the board, but she just dug herself deeper holes with just the lack of scoreboard pressure that she applied on EGA. She was broken right off the bat at 15. That just sent a horrible message and that didn\\'t help her settle any nerves at all. And she lost the match really I feel in the third game of the match when she was down love two because she had four game point opportunities to get on the board but she wasn\\'t able to capitalize and that remained the only time where she had a game point opportunity that only game that third game of the first set getting broken right off the bat in set number two. I think that was the final nail in the coffin for the American and with how well EGA had been serving not not only throughout this entire championships but again in this match. Amanda needed to have a perfect serving day and that day was not today at all. And Ega she cruised on her serve. She didn\\'t face a single break point while Amanda struggled immensely. Annie Samova, she hit zero aces, five double faults. She only made 45% of her first serves in the box and she only won 25% of the points whenever she did so. and she won more points behind her second serve, although it wasn\\'t that great. She won 35% of her second serve points. Ego though was on point on her serve. She made 78% of her first serves and she won 72% of her points whenever she did this and she won 63% of her second serve points. The winner to unforced error ratio tells a lot, too. Amanda, she hit eight winners to 28 unforced errors. Meanwhile, EA kept it clean and tidy with 10 winners to 11 unforced errors. Everything I mentioned in my finals preview really happened. Like I\\'m not going to spend too much time going over this match because first of all, there\\'s not much to go over, but I mentioned in my last video that Amanda, she was low-key very beatable in that semi-final against Sabalinka. Even though she did play well in that match, Arena let her off the hook big time with just missed returns. She missed so many returns. And I knew that Eagle would not do this considering how Shian is probably one of the most the best returners that we have right now on the tour. She\\'s just simply more consistent and she made Amanda play a lot more shots compared to Arena. EGA is just overall more consistent from the ground and she was able to draw more errors from Amanda able to more spread the court and maneuver Anisova around and we all know that Amanda is much more vulnerable on the move compared to whenever she is stationary and Samova no doubt she was already gassed from that Sabanka semi-final. So with EA moving her even more like at pretty much every point where Amanda was stretched wide she lost. And I know that some people were like, \"Oh, Annie Samova will bring her a new power that she hasn\\'t seen before.\" But I knew that was kind of cap because EGA has faced big hitters throughout this entire tournament. She faced Collins, beat her routinely. She beat Clara Talson routinely. She beat Samson Sonova pretty routinely. So, she was prepared for the pace and the power that Anisova would bring and she wasn\\'t phased at all. And I knew that EGA\\'s team would employ a great strategy for this match. And that was just attacking Anisova\\'s forehand relentlessly. Yes, Annie Samova\\'s forehand was not as sharp as it was against Sabalanka in that semi-final, but I also think that Arena gave Amanda way too many backhands to work with. Then on the flip side, I think that Annie Samova did not exploit EGA\\'s forehand at all. She didn\\'t really get out to the punch and try to pressure forehand. I don\\'t know what strategy she came out with, but it was the losing strategy. And I still think that if she had tried to pressure EA\\'s forehand a bit more, she could have drawn more unforced errors from Shiion, but she did not she did not do that at all. And I also think that a lot of EGA\\'s unforced errors from that wing, crazy unforced errors, come whenever things are tight for her and she wasn\\'t really tight at all in this final. I truly think that if Sabalinka had a better game plan, she could have beaten Anisova 6463 amidst how well Anisova was playing that match. Again, I do think that Amanda was pretty beatable. That said, I think Amanda\\'s this being her first ever match against EGA, let alone in a Wimbledon final, that was just a recipe for disaster. And the a lot of people have talked about how whenever you face Ego for the first time, that\\'s you need that experience of facing her because it\\'s really nothing like what many players bring at you on the tour at all. Plus, EGA, she\\'s just more experienced at this level and at these final stages. Coming into this one, she was 5-0 in major finals, 22 and five overall in finals, and then I think Anisova was like 2 and three, 3 and two in finals. And she of course has never been in this position of contesting for a slam trophy. EGA, I don\\'t even think she was in her top top shape. Yes, she played well, but I don\\'t think she was in like godlike form um in this final. She really didn\\'t have to bring it much because Anisova gifted her a lot with unforced errors. And I do think that she was vulnerable like a little bit. She showed some signs of vulnerability, but again, Anisova was way too shaky to take advantage and apply ample scoreboard pressure. I think this definitely is the worst land final that we\\'ve seen in decades. I think that alltime title belongs to Stephie Graph defeating Natasha Zva in the 1988 Roland Gar\\'s final where she again beat her six love six love but this one was 34 minutes. So at least this one was a little bit longer. It almost hit an hour mark. But I simply believe that there is only one woman to blame for this lopsided result and that\\'s Simona Halip. Halup was in attendance in the Royal box to watch this final. And I think that the spirit of 2019 win over over Serena just took over the censor court with her being there. And it\\'s crazy to me that even with this being a six love six love beatd down, it was still 1 minute longer than Serena\\'s 6262 loss to Halip in 2019. So so triggering. But anyways, I am the type of person to look at things from a glass half full perspective. So here\\'s this. I think that it is poetic for Amanda to start her win tournament with a six love six love beatd down win over Julia Poinsa in like 44 minutes than to end her tournament losing six love six love in the finals. That\\'s something that that\\'s kind of beautiful honestly in a way that you know ying and yang and and stuff. I mean I\\'m trying here y\\'all. I\\'m trying. But in all seriousness I do feel for Amanda for sure. And it was triggering for triggering for me low-key because for my high school state final. I of course played tennis. I lost six love, six love. Granted, I did have um three game points in the first game, but the guy was just better than me. That was the whole case. But with Amanda, it was different because she was a little bit more gassed. But point being, I understand where she\\'s coming from and playing like the biggest match of your career and getting like goose egged or double bag. It\\'s definitely not easy. It was beautiful though to see that moment with her and her mom. You know, she got really emotional and I think this was the first time where her mom flew out to watch her play because Amanda was superstitious. I mean, superstitions are for a reason. So, I think Amanda\\'s mama probably should have stayed home. I\\'m not saying she would have won this match, but maybe she would have won at least a game if Amanda\\'s mama decided to stay home. I really think that this one just came down to to nerves. And even Amanda said in her postmatch press conference that she was a little bit frozen coming out to play this match. Amanda also said, \"I didn\\'t practice yesterday. I think that was just really fatigue. I could feel it also in my warm-up this morning. I mean, I had to take a break after every single rally out there in my warm-up. I think if anything, it\\'s my physicality that I need to work on to be able to last two weeks in a Grand Slam is definitely something that you need to work on a lot. It\\'s not an easy feat. Yeah, there\\'s a lot of room for improvement. If anything, I think it\\'s more experience for me on how to handle my nerves. It\\'s my first final, so at least I have that experience now.\" I do think that of course Amanda will be able to recover okay from this even though this was a pretty embarrassing result. She has a good excuse of her being a little bit more gassed and this being her first slam final. Will this be her first and last slam final? If I were to guess, I\\'d say I think she\\'ll be in this position before. Um I think that she will win a slam at least. She\\'s still only 23 years old, so she she still has time for sure. And she at least will walk away being a slam finalist. Even if she does never reach another slam final, she can have that in the back of her pocket. And focusing on the present, she will leave a top 10 player. She will make her top 10 debut on Monday, sitting at number seven in the rankings. So, she still has so much to be proud of, and this will be a huge milestone in her making his final. And I feel like a lot of us will remember that epic South Blanca semi-final win. So congratulations to Amanda. Just thinking back to where she was not even 2 years ago, a year and a half ago on that hiatus and now being back in a slam final, she would have taken this even if she even though she did lose Love and Love, she would have definitely taken this 10 times out of 10. So it\\'s still an inspiring feat for her to come back and after taking that mental health hiatus and make us final. So again, full props to Amanda for for her effort and in coming back. Now, talking about our champion, I mean, what more to say? And it\\'s wow, too, that this is EGA\\'s 100th slam singles win, main draw win. And really, what a way to do it to to win love and love in a woman final to win your first Wimbledon title. And we really shouldn\\'t be surprised though because the legendary Venus Golf, they did predict this essentially before the tournament started. So, congratulations to Venus Golf for defending their Wimbledon title and predicting the the correct women\\'s champion two years in a row before the draw even dropped. So, got to give props to Venus Golf. I also think that it\\'s a cool parallel between Koko and EGA because they both won junior titles in 2018. Koko won Roland Garros, Ego won, and now here we are 7 years later and they won, you know, Koko won Roland Garos the women\\'s uh edition. Ego won Wimbledon women\\'s edition. Really, EA just quieted the critics with this title run. Undoubtedly, Bud Onborg was so instrumental to her and her getting this success and getting this win because even though she didn\\'t win the title, her getting over the semi-finals hump and actually, you know, winning a semi-final after not winning one in over a year was huge and gave her a lot of confidence. And I think her year, even though people called it a flop year, it wasn\\'t a bad year overall when you look at it because she played really well at the majors, making the semi-finals at both the Australian Open and Roland Geros. And I think that she really was a point away from winning the Australian Open. I think that if she did get that match point over Keys, she would have won in the final against Sabalinka. I can\\'t say that definitively, but that\\'s just my opinion. playing devil\\'s advocate. I mean, we can say that she did have a decline in form because some of her losses, namely Yala Miami, that was a rough loss. Golf, yes, Koko played amazing, but being double bread stick, EGA played horribly. And I think at in those losses, her forehand just went ary, but here her forehand stuck together and that\\'s ultimately why she won the title. It was a clean title run from her. And EGA, she says something important to ESPN. She said that she enjoyed her center court experience playing on center court, not being nervous about it. And that\\'s ultimately what made the difference between her and Amanda. She put no pressure on herself, not only for this final, but leading into it. You know, she was at her lowest in a while because people were not expecting much at all from her. And that just goes to show how much of that struggle period that EGA faced was due to her nerves. because now that she came into Wen without any like really pressure or expectation, she ran the gauntlet and won the tournament with relative ease. And I do feel like somewhat of an apology is owed to Wim Fett because I raised the question plenty of times of whether he eager needed to fire Whim, especially after she wasn\\'t able to win Roland Geralt. But the main reason of why she brought Whim in is to have success outside of Roland Garros. And they accomplished the goal together. What more can you ask for? She won Wimbledon, the one title that people thought that she might never win. Whim did his job. Full credit to Whim. I mean, I stand corrected. I\\'m I\\'m one to give people, you know, their tens and when it\\'s due and when I\\'m wrong, I\\'m wrong. And I was definitely wrong here. So, congratulations to Whim, of course, too. And EGA, she proved a lot for sure with this title run that she can thrive on any surface. She was very aggressive throughout this tournament and she made big improvements on her serve and she was not relying too as much on her defense, but she was still able to draw a lot of unforced errors from her opponent just based off of how solid she was from the ground. And like I mentioned in my finals preview, much of Eagle\\'s EGA struggles at Wen in the past, I think were rooted in her exerting a lot of her energy for the clay swing, just winning dang near everything. Now this year, she didn\\'t win a single thing. She came in much more like refreshed I feel and more motivated to do better at Wen. I think that Ego was a bit more complacent in Warden\\'s previous years because she again expended all her energy on the clay swing. She\\'d won a lot this year. She came in hungry, motivated and also without the pressure and that\\'s what resulted in this this title. Now, another talking point I want to briefly touch on because I know that people will will say it is that EGA had a cakewalk draw. And I don\\'t know if I necessarily say that because on paper before the draw kind of crumbled, EGA had a tough draw. I mean, she was in the section with Rebakina, a former Women Champion. Although Rebakina isn\\'t the same, Robbakina that won Wimbledon those years prior, she\\'s still a tough out on grass. And it\\'s not her fault that Rebaka lost. And still even then Clara Talson was playing well and she\\'s a good opponent. Danielle Collins is dangerous. She beat EA the last time they played on Clay Ega\\'s best surface. So that was a good win. And Sam Senova again a solid opponent. And yes, we cannot deny that Benic and Anamova did not bring their best games at all. Didn\\'t really test EA at all. And EGA, she actually finished the tournament 19 games won in a row dating back from that Benich semi-final which is incredible. But I mean, there\\'s nothing much that EGA could have done to prevent that. Like, EGA did her job and won. And that\\'s simple as that. It\\'s not her fault either that the top seeds flopped so bad and fell early in week one. She simply was the best. And I don\\'t know how many people could have beaten her in this tournament. I think that even if Sabalinka made the finals, EGA would have won. Danger wouldn\\'t have been no love and love, but wouldn\\'t be surprised if it were straight sets win for EGA\\'s favor. And it\\'s crazy to think in hindsight that Katie McN was the one that tested Fiance the most. And it\\'s obvious because Katie brings a different challenge and that she isn\\'t a a big ball basher and that she brings in more variety. But to that brings back to another point of that we all think of EGA to struggle the most against the bigger hitters, but she handled every single big hitter. She passed the test tremendously. So again, props to EGA for that. Looking ahead, the question is, what can we expect from EGA from here on out? Will we experience another EGA dominance era and period? I\\'m leaning more towards no simply because I do think that regardless of how well EGA played, the tour is just more tough compared to 2022 and the players will challenge her still on even still on the faster surfaces. Having predictions for EGA slam total count, I think that she will at least get to 15 slams. She\\'s already at six. She\\'s 24 years old and it\\'s crazy that she\\'s one away from Venus, which as a Venus fan, that\\'s disappointing that she wasn\\'t able to win more slams. I mean, yes, she can. Venus can add to her slam tally. She\\'s coming back. She\\'s playing DC. Um, so maybe she can get her eighth at the US Open. You never know. You never know. Crazier things have No, that that\\'s not going to happen. But I think that regardless, this was a big hurdle for her to overcome this, you know, down period that she faced, even though the down period wasn\\'t even that bad because she even talked to ESPN about it. She said that the critics got to her a little bit. And she said that now that she got this title, she hopes that people will kind of like shut up, for lack of a better word, and let her do her job. And I think it\\'ll be a weight lifted off her shoulder now that she got o again got over the hump and won a slam title. So, I don\\'t know. the tour. The tour might need to be shaken in their boots a little bit now that EGA is definitely back and out of the trenches. So, not much more to say except for congratulations to both Venus Golf and EGA on an incredible Wimbledon run. That is all I have for this Wimbledon women\\'s final recap video and let me know your thoughts on it. And I know there\\'s going to be plenty of strong opinionated opinions on it, but please in the comments, not too much on Amanda. She was gassed and this was her first final appearance. So, be kind to the comments, y\\'all. Also, let me know your thoughts on EGA\\'s future and whether you think that she can get to 15 slams and maybe beyond, maybe even reach 20 slams. Again, make sure you all subscribe and click the notification bell so you are notified whenever I post my Wimbledon men\\'s final recap video. Thank you all so much for watching and for your support. And I will see you all next time here on Christian\\'s Court.'},\n",

Welcome to the press conference for Carlos Alcarez. Please raise your hand if you would like to ask a question. Carlos, obviously not the result you were hoping for today, but overall a good championships. Yeah, it's uh I mean it's it's always a a bad feeling, you know, losing losing matches. I think it's a little bit uh even even worse when you you're losing a final. But, you know, overall, I'm just really proud about everything. I I I've done, you know, the the last four weeks on on grass here in in London and just uh leave uh leave Wimbledon, I just left the court with the with the head really really high because you know that I just uh did everything that I could today just I played against uh someone who who played an unbelievable uh unbelievable game. So just uh uh a little bit sad about losing but with the with the head really high. Simon, Not a serot today it felt like you weren't a serot today. Not a serot. I mean, it was uh today was complicated a little bit. Uh, you know, low percentage of of of first serve and then, you know, I I was uh I played against uh one of the best returning on on tour without doubt. So, uh it was u it was a weapon that uh I wish uh I wish he could he it he could uh be better but uh today was um I mean with the with the nerfs and and everything it was difficult to to serve better so I just have to to improve that. Yeah, absolutely. What did you learn from last summer Matt, uh hey Carlos. Uh tough tough luck. Um, the last time you lost a big final like this last summer at the Olympics, it it took you a while to sort of bounce back, it seemed like. And I'm sort of curious, what did you learn from that experience that you can now apply to this experience about bouncing back and moving on? Well, I think it's different. Uh, it's it's a different a different feeling uh to be honest. Uh yeah, LA last year, you know, in the Olympics, I just uh I was uh I was I was really uh bad emotionally uh after after the match. So it was it was really really hard for me to to accept that uh that moment. Uh and and right now I think that you know in the last in the last year uh I've been through in a different situations that I that I learned uh I learned from from then and right now I'm in a position that I've I've uh I've spoken a few times already that okay I just uh I just accept everything that is coming to me uh in the way it comes like uh okay I just uh I I just lost a final in a grand slam, but I just really proud about being in a final. So, um I just want to to keep uh the the good moments uh and trying to forget, you know, the uh the like the bad moments and just want to think like, okay, I I just played the final grand slam and trying to forget that I lost it. It's just about I I I was able to play it. Uh, and I just want to to accept it. So, right now I'm just, as I said, I'm not I'm not bad at all. Uh, I'm just uh happy. Uh, I'm smiling because uh in my head is it was about playing playing the final and uh and be grateful grateful for that. The rivalry with Daniil Medvedev Hi, Carlos. The rivalry with Yanik. Um, how much does it mean for you to have an opponent at that level and where do you think this rivalry is going? Well, I first of all, I just really really happy about having this rivalry with with him. Uh I think it's is great for for us is and and it is great for the tennis. Uh every time we we playing against each other, I think we our level is is really high. I I think we we don't we don't watch uh a level a level like this if I'm if I'm honest with you. uh I don't see any any player playing against each other uh you know having the level that they we playing when when we face each other. I think as I said many many times this rivalry is is it's uh coming better than better. We're building a really great rivalry because we're playing final of a grand slam final of master of master the best tournament in the world. So um and and it's going to be better and better and I'm just really grateful for for that because it gives me uh the opportunity to to just uh give my 100% every practice every day just to just to be better thanks thanks to that because you know the level uh that I have to maintain and I have to raise if I want to beat Danik is uh is really high. So I just really grateful for that. Did Daniil surprise you Helena, hi Carlos BL today. Obviously the the defeat for Yanick in Paris was a really difficult one. Did he surprise you with the way he was able to get over that so quickly and and come back and win here? Not at all. The he didn't surprise me at all because uh I know he's a really nice uh player and uh a huge champion. Uh and the the the champions uh learn from from the I'm not going to say failures, but uh they they they learn from the from the losers. Uh, and I knew at the beginning that he was going to to learn from from that final. Uh, not going to uh make the same the same mistakes as u as they did in in in the French Open final. So u the way he played today was uh it was really really high and I didn't surprise at all. It was uh or I knew he he was playing he was going to play like this. Um, so he was uh he was about some some details uh and and uh yeah I mean overall it's he didn't he didn't surprise surprise me at all because I know he's a he's a big champion. How did you feel during the match Carol, can I just ask you how you felt in terms of energy during this match because it seemed that maybe in the middle of this match you hit a bit of a rough patch of energy physically. Did you feel you had enough in the time to to go the distance today? Well, he just um No, I didn't I didn't feel down uh physically at all during during the match. It was uh it was all about uh you know, he was pushing me uh to the limit in in every point. So mentally sometimes it's really tough to maintain you know the uh the good focus or the good level uh during the whole match when when you see the opponent just playing such a great tennis uh and at some points I I didn't know what what I had to do uh in the match because uh from the baselines from the baseline I was uh I was feeling he was better than me and I couldn't do anything about it. Um and um and I think you know big uh the big key was uh it was about the second serve. So he he was returning really well the second serve that I that he was hitting uh and uh it is uh and thanks to that he he was in the position to attack in the in the second ball every time. So it was really difficult when you're feeling that you you just defending all the time and running from from side to side all the time. So that that that was my my feeling but I didn't I didn't fail down physically that and that that the What did you need to do better answer. Okay. Last English question. Willie Carlos, what do you think you need to do better if anything to do better against him next time? Well, I think uh well surfaces are really uh you know different. Uh and I think for example today playing on grass I think the sec as I said as I said the second ser are really really important and I and I feel like I just uh gave him a lot of free points when he was serving the second serve. Uh, okay. He has a big first serve. That's obviously and I just try to return or win points from the first side that that it is more more difficult. But that when when you're have the chance to return a second serve, I had to to do more uh with uh with those points. I had to return better. I had to uh or I had to try to be in the position of attack after the the return. And um you know I just uh felt he was uh serving really or or quite quite easily uh and he was winning his uh surf game quite easily because uh because of that it wasn't uh push uh push him you know to to have nerves you know on the on the serves game. So I I think I have to be better on on that. Overall it was a it was a great match. I think the level from the best was really high and uh I think that that was the the big different between both of us today. Okay, thank you. We'll switch to Spanish questions.\"},\n",

That's it. Y takes his piece of Wimbledon history. What a wonderful match. Heat up here. Yan ends the reign of Carlos Alarez. A triumph at Wimbledon. And after the pain, the agony of that friendship and loss and in a fourth Grand Slam final in a row, he shows the strength of his character. And now he makes the walk and will be guided to the player support box. And they've been through it, too. right from when he took up this silly game. And that's really, really nice. Darren Cahill and the team and they've played their part from the moment that he left home at 13 and pursued this sport rather than skiing or football. He was destined to be a very fine player, but who's to say who will become a grand slam champion and who will not. Well, mom looks a lot happier than she did at the French Open after 5 and 1/2 hours. It's an incredible performance and it's a team effort. You can see what it means to everyone up there and 35 days ago to go through that heartache of Roland Garrison, then come back here in his next Grand Slam opportunity and take the title. Well, it it does show you how incredibly mentally strong he is. And there's his mom and a hug for her. But the resilience he's shown this year, we know he's gone through his battles on and off the court. But to come back from Paris and to make this statement shows how good he is and how good he is going to be for many years to come. In many ways, this is a good thing for the rivalry because Alcarez had won five straight matches against him. And now Sinn proves to himself after a break of nearly two years that he can beat Arazz on the biggest stages.\"}]"
